I-I-I-I-I'm not your steppin' stone
I-I-I-I-I'm not your steppin' stone
You're trying to make your mark in society
You're using all the tricks that you used on me
You're reading all them high-fashion magazines
The clothes you're wearing, girl, they're causing public scenes
I said, I-I-I-I-I'm not your steppin' stone
I-I-I-I-I'm not your steppin' stone
Not your steppin' stone
Not your steppin' stone
When I first met you, girl, you didn't have no shoes
But, now you're walking around like you're front-page news
You've been awful careful 'bout the friends you choose
But, you won't find my name in your book of "who's-who?"
I said, I-I-I-I-I'm not your steppin' stone
(No, girl, not me!)
I-I-I-I-I'm not your steppin' stone
Not your steppin' stone
I'm not your steppin' stone
Not your steppin' stone (step-step-steppin' stone)
Not your steppin' stone (step-step-steppin' stone)
Not your steppin' stone (step-step-steppin' stone)
Not your steppin' stone (step-step-steppin' stone)
No, girl, I'm not your steppin' stone
Not your steppin' stone (step-step-steppin' stone)
Not your steppin' stone (step-step-steppin' stone)
